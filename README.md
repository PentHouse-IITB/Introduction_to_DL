# Introduction_to_DL

This project is an introduction to Deep Learning and its various application using the popular framework named Tensorflow. Having prior knowledge of Machine Learning and some experience in python is recommended but not necessary. You can go through some resources shared in our [Intro to ML repo](https://github.com/PentHouse-IITB/Introduction_to_ML). This is how we are planning to proceed:
1. Understanding the concepts behind deep learning architectures and training approaches
2. Getting used to the Tensorflow framework (keras specifically)
3. Training some basic neural networks
4. Introduction to Computer Vision and CNNs
5. Some advanced concepts in CNNs
6. Applying all the concepts into real world problems

We won't be covering natural language processing and some recent advancements such as GANs as it would be very difficult to cover everything in the given time frame.

Some of the resources for getting used to the concepts behind deep learning and basic terminologies:
1. [Medium article series](https://medium.com/intro-to-artificial-intelligence/deep-learning-series-1-intro-to-deep-learning-abb1780ee20)
2. [More about Perceptron Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-deep-learning-and-neural-networks-deep-learning-for-rookies-1-bd68f9cf5883)
There a lot of other youtube playlists and courses which cover the deep learning basics and in some cases advanced stuff too. To name some:
1. [Coursera Deep Learning Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
2. [Udemy Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)

Both courses mentioned here also involve code exercises as well which will be good practice to hone you python skills and get introduced to tensorflow.
There are also tutorials available on various websites. The short tutorials on Kaggle are often recommended.

Once we are a bit confident with tensorflow and have made some basic regression and classification models, we can move on to working with images
Here I would recommend starting the [CNN course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning) of the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew NG to understand the theory behind CNNs and how we train them. Example notebooks would be provided for your reference.

We end our project with some application of the theory learnt on an interesting problem statement
